# House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts house prices based on various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and more. The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using different regression algorithms.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy (Data Processing)
- Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data Visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains features such as:
- **Lot Area**
- **Number of Bedrooms & Bathrooms**
- **Square Footage**
- **Year Built**
- **Location**
- **Other property-specific details**

## 📊 Machine Learning Models Used
- **Linear Regression**
- **Decision Tree Regressor**
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **Gradient Boosting Regressor**

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://https://https://github.com/SivaAditya11/Machine-Learning-Powered-Real-Estate-Price-Prediction-/tree/main/archive

2. Install the required dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   jupyter notebook
   
4. Open and execute the notebooks inside the `notebooks/` directory to explore data and train models.

## 📈 Results
- Performance of models is evaluated using metrics like **Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R²)**.
- Visualizations to understand feature importance and predictions.
